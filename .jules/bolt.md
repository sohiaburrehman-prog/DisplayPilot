## 2024-05-24 - `GetMonitors` causes micro-stutters when called on timer
**Learning:** In this project, `DisplayManager.GetMonitors()` triggers expensive Win32 GPU queries (`QueryDisplayConfig`). When invoked repeatedly in the `ProcessWatcherService` polling loop (like during profile tracking), it causes noticeable application micro-stutters.
**Action:** Always cache the target monitor information or avoid calling `GetMonitors()` on a timer/loop when tracking state that does not change frequently.
## 2024-05-24 - `QueryActiveConfig` is an expensive Win32 call
**Learning:** `QueryActiveConfig` (which wraps `QueryDisplayConfig`) is an expensive Win32 API call. When retrieving monitor information, we were making this call twice: once for friendly names and once for virtual-desktop bounds.
**Action:** Combine operations that rely on `QueryActiveConfig` into a single loop to halve the number of expensive system calls and reduce micro-stutters when `GetMonitors` is called.
## 2026-07-23 - Unnecessary `GetMonitors` in ProcessWatcherService idle loop
**Learning:** The polling loop in `ProcessWatcherService.ReconcileWinner` fetches display configurations even when no profiles are active and no session needs ending, contributing to overhead.
**Action:** Implemented a fast path in the reconciliation loop to return early when idle, preventing expensive `GetMonitors()` calls when they are not needed.
